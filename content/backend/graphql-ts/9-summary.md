In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed JavaScript at Any Scale.
- [`Fastify`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/) An efficient server for Node.js
- [GraphQL Helix](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/): A highly evolved GraphQL HTTP Server with zero dependencies except for graphql-js itself
- [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) The JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL
- [`Envelop`](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop) Envelop is a lightweight JavaScript library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins, while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Replaces traditional ORMs. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of
  GraphQL resolvers.
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql): A "GraphQL IDE" that allows you to interactively
  explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It's somewhat similar to
  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using Prisma Client which is responsible for database access.

If you want to dive deeper and become part of the awesome GraphQL community, here are a few resource and community
recommendations for you:

- [Prisma Blog](https://prisma.io/blog): The blog regularly features new and interesting content about GraphQL, from
  community news to technical deep dives and various tutorials.
- [GraphQL Weekly](https://graphqlweekly.com): A weekly GraphQL newsletter with news from the GraphQL ecosystem
- [GraphQL Conf](https://www.graphqlconf.org): The world's biggest gathering of GraphQL enthusiasts happening in the
  heart of Berlin
- [Prisma Slack](https://slack.prisma.io): A Slack team with vivid discussions around everything GraphQL & Prisma
- [The Guild Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/xud7bH9): The Guild Discord GraphQL community
- [The Guild Blog](https://the-guild.dev/blog/): The Guild Discord GraphQL community

Congratulations on completing the tutorial! We can't wait to see what you build.
